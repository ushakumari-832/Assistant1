## Copilot Experience

I used GitHub Copilot to generate a Python script (`copilot_test.py`) that prints the system uptime. Copilot provided the following code:

```python
import os

def get_uptime():
    if os.name == 'posix':
        with open('/proc/uptime', 'r') as f:
            uptime_seconds = float(f.readline().split()[0])
            uptime_string = str(int(uptime_seconds // 3600)) + " hours, " + \
                            str(int((uptime_seconds % 3600) // 60)) + " minutes"
            return uptime_string
    else:
        return "System uptime not supported on this OS."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("System Uptime:", get_uptime())
```

### Modifications

I used the script as generated by Copilot. No modifications were necessary, as it worked correctly on my Linux system.

### Testing

To test the script, I ran it in my terminal using:

```bash
python copilot_test.py
```

The script printed the system uptime in hours and minutes, confirming it works as expected on Linux.

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have Python installed (`python3` recommended).
2. Save the script above as `copilot_test.py` in your repository.
3. Run the script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python copilot_test.py
   ```

You should see output similar to:

```
System Uptime: 5 hours, 23 minutes
```

**Note:** This script works on Linux systems (using `/proc/uptime`). For other operating systems, additional changes may be needed.
